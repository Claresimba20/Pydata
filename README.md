# Food Consumption and CO2 emissions analysis
This project explores global food consumption patterns and their impact on CO2 emisions.
Using Python the analysis highlights:
* CO2 emissions by food category across  countries
* Comparison of animal vs plant-based foods
* Regional focus on East Africa
The goal is to understand how dietary choices  affect the carbon footprint

## Tech stack
* Python
* Pandas:Data cleaning and manipulation
* Matplotlib/seaborn:Data visualizations

## Key insights
* Beef has the highest carbon footprint globally.
* Plant-based foods contribute significantly less to COâ‚‚ emissions.
